# hw Metrics
### metric.hw.energy

Energy consumed by the component.


### metric.hw.errors

Number of errors encountered by the component.


### metric.hw.host.ambient_temperature

Ambient (external) temperature of the physical host.


### metric.hw.host.energy

Total energy consumed by the entire physical host, in joules.


### metric.hw.host.heating_margin

By how many degrees Celsius the temperature of the physical host can be increased, before reaching a warning threshold on one of the internal sensors.



### metric.hw.host.power

Instantaneous power consumed by the entire physical host in Watts (`hw.host.energy` is preferred).



### metric.hw.power

Instantaneous power consumed by the component.


### metric.hw.status

Operational status: `1` (true) or `0` (false) for each of the possible states.
